Simon is an electronic game of short-term memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, working for toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates, with software programming by Lenny Cope. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence.

Test your memory and reaction time by playing Simon, the iconic game where you need to remember the pattern of colors and sounds.
